    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: May 17, 2025</em></p>

    <p>Welcome to remra! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the remra app ("the App"). By using remra, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the app.</p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>remra is a daily task reminders app designed to help you stay focused and productive. It does not require an account, store personal information on our servers, or collect any data from you.</p>

    <h2>2. Use of the App</h2>
    <p>You may use the app only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the app in any way that could interfere with its normal operation</li>
        <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer or exploit the app's underlying code</li>
        <li>Use the app to store or transmit harmful, illegal, or offensive content</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The tasks you create in remra are stored <strong>only on your device</strong> using local storage. We do not have access to, store, or process any of your data on our servers. Your data is completely private and under your control.</p>

    <h2>4. Modifications and Updates</h2>
    <p>We may update or modify the app at any time, including adding or removing features. We may also revise these Terms. Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the revised Terms.</p>

    <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The remra name, logo, and all associated design elements are the intellectual property of the creators of remra. You may not use our branding without permission.</p>

    <h2>6. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>remra is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. While we aim to provide a stable and useful app, we do not guarantee that it will be error-free or uninterrupted.</p>
    <p>We are not liable for any loss of data, productivity, or other damages resulting from your use of the app. Since your data is stored locally on your device, you are responsible for backing up any important information.</p>

    <h2>7. Termination</h2>
    <p>You can stop using remra at any time by uninstalling the app. Since we don't store any of your data, there is no account to terminate or data to remove from our servers.</p>

    <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of your jurisdiction. Any legal disputes must be resolved in accordance with those laws.</p>
