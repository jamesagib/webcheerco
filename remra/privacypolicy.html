    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: May 17, 2025</em></p>

    <p>remra ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your data when you use the remra reminders app ("the App").</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>a. Task Data</strong><br>
    When you use remra, the tasks you create ‚Äî including titles, scheduled times, and completion statuses ‚Äî are temporarily synced to our secure database. This allows us to deliver core functionality such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reminder notifications</li>
        <li>App performance enhancements</li>
        <li>Temporary syncing across devices (if supported)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No personal information or user accounts are required or collected.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>All task data synced to our servers is <strong>automatically deleted after the day is over</strong> (based on your local time). We do not store your task history beyond the current day.</p>
    <p>Local data may remain on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>We use the collected task data solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enable reminders and notifications</li>
        <li>Support app functionality and performance</li>
        <li>Maintain temporary backup during your session</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share your data with any third parties.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your data using modern security standards, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Encryption of data during transmission</li>
        <li>Access controls on our servers</li>
        <li>Automated routines to delete stored data after each day</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, no system is 100% secure. By using remra, you acknowledge this risk and agree to use the app at your own discretion.</p>

    <h2>5. Children‚Äôs Privacy</h2>
    <p>remra is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received such information, we will delete it promptly.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>Because remra does not require accounts or long-term storage, you are in full control of your data. You may:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Edit or delete your tasks at any time</li>
        <li>Uninstall the app to remove all local data</li>
        <li>Rely on our automatic server-side deletion after each day</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If changes are made, the ‚ÄúLast Updated‚Äù date will be revised. Significant changes will be communicated within the app or via our website.</p>
