    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: May 17, 2025</em></p>

    <p>Welcome to Jecca! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Jecca app ("the App"). By using Jecca, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the app.</p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>Jecca is a daily task reminders app designed to help you stay focused and productive. It does not require an account or store personal information long-term.</p>

    <h2>2. Use of the App</h2>
    <p>You may use the app only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the app in any way that could interfere with its normal operation</li>
        <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer or exploit the appâ€™s underlying code or services</li>
        <li>Use the app to store or transmit harmful, illegal, or offensive content</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. User Content</h2>
    <p>The tasks you create in Jecca are stored temporarily to support app functionality and reminders. All tasks are automatically deleted after the day is over, and we do not retain long-term records.</p>

    <h2>4. Modifications and Updates</h2>
    <p>We may update or modify the app at any time, including adding or removing features. We may also revise these Terms. Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the revised Terms.</p>

    <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The Jecca name, logo, and all associated design elements are the intellectual property of the creators of Jecca. You may not use our branding without permission.</p>

    <h2>6. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>Jecca is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. While we aim to provide a stable and useful app, we do not guarantee that it will be error-free or uninterrupted.</p>
    <p>We are not liable for any loss of data, productivity, or other damages resulting from your use of the app.</p>

    <h2>7. Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to terminate or suspend access to the app at any time and for any reason, without prior notice.</p>

    <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of your jurisdiction. Any legal disputes must be resolved in accordance with those laws.</p>
